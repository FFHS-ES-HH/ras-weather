piweather
=========

piweather is an application that runs on the Raspberry Pi that is connected to a weather
station from tinkerforge. The application displays the following weather related values on
the LCD:

* temperature
* humidity
* air pressure
* illuminance

Besides displaying thos values, piweather stores them in an sqlite3 database.

Configuration
-------------

The application is configured by the configuration file `/etc/piweather/piweather.conf`.
The file is self explanatory and it allows the configuration of the sensor sensitivities,
the location of the database and so on. The most important things are the host and the
port of the connected weather station.

Database
--------

The database contains all measured values. A record contains the following fields:

* `id`, the primary key in ascending order. INTEGER
* `temperature`, the temperature in Grad Celsius. REAL NOT NULL
* `humidity`, the humidity in %, REAL NOT NULL
* `pressure` the air pressure in mbar, REAL NOT NULL
* `illuminance`, the illuminance in lux, REAL NOT NULL
* `created_at`, the timestamp of creation of this record, INTEGER NOT NULL
